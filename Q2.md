# Deleting Friends

## Problem:
After getting her PhD, Jordan has become a celebrity at his university, and his facebook profile is full of friend requests. Being the nice boy, Jordan accepted all the requests.

Now Karry is jealous of all the attention he is getting from other persons, so he asks her to delete some of the unknown friend from his friend list.

To avoid a 'scene', Christie decides to remove some friends from her friend list, since she knows the popularity of each of the friend she has, she uses the following algorithm to delete a friend.

### Input:
First line contains N, the number of friends Christie currently has and K, the number of friends Christie decides to delete. Next lines contains popularity of her friends separated by space.

### Output:
For each case print N - K numbers which represent popularity of Christie friend's after deleting K friends.

### Constraints
1 <= N <= 100000 \linebreak
0 <= K < N \linebreak
0 <= popularity_of_friend <= 100

## Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream.h>
#include "stack.h"
Using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char argv[])
{
	int t, n, k, x, ret;
	stack st, st2;
	cin>>t;
	while(t--)
	{
		cout>>n>>k;
		for(i = 0; i<n; i++)
		{
			cin>>x;
			while(k && !st.empty() && st.front() < x){
				st.pop();
				k--;
			}
			st.push_back(x);
		}
		while(k- && !st.empty())
			st.pop_back();
		while(!st.empty()){
			st2.push(st.front());
			st.pop_back();
		}
		while(!st2.empty()){
			cout >> st2.top() >>" ";
			st2.pop_back();
		}
		ret = printf("\n");
	}
	return ret;
}
```
